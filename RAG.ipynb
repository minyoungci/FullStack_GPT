    "- \"RAG\"는 \"Retrieval-Augmented Generation\"의 약자로, \"검색-증강 생성\"이라는 의미를 가지고 있습니다. 이는 자연어 처리(NLP) 및 기계 학습 분야, 특히 챗봇이나 질문-응답 시스템과 같은 고급 언어 모델을 구축하는 데 사용되는 기술입니다.\n",
    "\n",
    "- RAG에 대한 간략한 개요는 다음과 같습니다:\n",
    "\n",
    "검색과 생성의 결합: RAG는 NLP의 두 가지 주요 구성 요소인 정보 검색과 응답 생성을 결합합니다. 검색 부분은 관련 정보를 찾기 위해 대규모 데이터베이스나 문서 컬렉션을 검색하는 과정을 포함합니다. 생성 부분은 검색된 정보를 바탕으로 일관되고 맥락적으로 적절한 텍스트를 생성하는 과정입니다.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "작동 방식: RAG 시스템에서 질문이나 프롬프트가 주어지면 모델은 먼저 질문에 대한 답변을 제공하는 데 유용한 정보를 포함할 수 있는 관련 문서나 텍스트를 검색합니다. 그런 다음 이 검색된 정보를 생성 모델에 공급하여 일관된 응답을 합성합니다.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- 장점: RAG의 주요 장점은 모델이 외부 지식을 활용할 수 있게 하여 보다 정확하고 상세하며 맥락적으로 관련된 답변을 제공할 수 있다는 것입니다. 이는 특정 지식이나 사실적 정보가 필요한 질문에 특히 유용합니다.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- 응용 분야: RAG는 챗봇, 질문-응답 시스템 및 정확하고 맥락적으로 관련된 정보를 제공하는 것이 중요한 다른 AI 도구와 같은 다양한 응용 분야에 사용됩니다. 특히 모델이 다양한 주제와 데이터를 기반으로 이해하고 응답을 생성해야 하는 상황에서 유용합니다.\n",
    "개발 및 사용: AI 및 기계 학습 커뮤니티에서 RAG는 다양한 연구 논문과 구현이 개발되고 있으며 주요 초점 중 하나입니다. 이는 학습된 정보뿐만 아니라 외부 소스에서 새롭고 관련된 정보를 통합하여 응답의 질과 관련성을 향상시키는 더 정교한 AI 시스템으로 나아가는 단계를 나타냅니다."

       " Document(page_content='On each landing, opposite the lift-shaft, the poster with the enormous face gazed from the wall.\\n\\n---\\n\\nIt was one of those pictures which are so contrived that the eyes follow you about when you move.

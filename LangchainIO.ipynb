On a clean surface or in a large mixing bowl, pour the flour and create a well in the center.\\n2. Crack the eggs into the well and add the salt.\\n3. Using a fork or your fingers, gradually mix the eggs and salt into the flour, incorporating a little at a time.\\n4. Once the dough starts to come together, knead it with your hands until it forms a smooth and elastic ball. If the dough is too dry, you can add a little water, teaspoon by teaspoon, until it reaches the desired consistency. If it's too wet, add a little more flour.\\n5. Once the dough is formed, cover it with a clean kitchen towel or plastic wrap and let it rest for about 30 minutes. This will allow the gluten to relax and make the dough easier to work with.\\n6. After resting, divide the dough into smaller portions. Take one portion and flatten it with your hands or a rolling pin until it's about 1/4 inch thick.\\n7. If you have a pasta machine, you can use it to roll out the dough into thin sheets. Start with the widest setting and gradually decrease the thickness until you reach the desired thickness for your pasta. If you don't have a pasta machine, you can use a rolling pin to roll out the dough as thin as possible.\\n8. Once the dough is rolled out, you can cut it into your desired pasta shape. For example, you can make fettuccine by cutting the dough into long, thin strips or make ravioli by placing a filling on one sheet of dough, covering it with another sheet, and sealing the edges.\\n9. As you cut the pasta, dust it with flour to prevent sticking.\\n10. Once the pasta is cut, you can cook it immediately in a large pot of salted boiling water for about 2-3 minutes or until al dente. Fresh pasta cooks much faster than dried pasta, so keep an eye on it.\\n11. Drain the cooked pasta and serve it with your favorite sauce or toppings.\\n\\nEnjoy your homemade Italian pasta!\""

Once the dough is formed, cover it with a clean kitchen towel or plastic wrap and let it rest for about 30 minutes. This allows the gluten to relax and makes the dough easier to work with.\\n\\n6. After resting, divide the dough into smaller portions. Take one portion and flatten it with your hands or a rolling pin until it's about 1/4 inch thick.\\n\\n7. If you have a pasta machine, pass the dough through the machine, starting with the widest setting and gradually reducing the thickness until you reach the desired thickness for your pasta. If you don't have a pasta machine, you can use a rolling pin to roll out the dough as thin as possible.\\n\\n8. Once the dough is rolled out, you can cut it into your desired pasta shape. For example, you can cut it into thin strips for spaghetti or fettuccine, or into squares for ravioli.\\n\\n9. As you cut the pasta, dust it with flour to prevent sticking. You can also hang the pasta on a drying rack or lay it flat on a clean surface until you're ready to cook it.\\n\\n10. To cook the pasta, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the pasta and cook it until al dente, which means it's cooked but still slightly firm to the bite. The cooking time will vary depending on the thickness and shape of the pasta, so taste it occasionally to check for doneness.\\n\\n11. Once the pasta is cooked, drain it well and serve it with your favorite sauce or toppings.\\n\\nEnjoy your homemade Italian pasta!\""
